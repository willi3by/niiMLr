# niiMLr

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of niiMLr is to wrap functions from other neuroimaging and deep learning
packages to facilitate 3D neural network modeling. Many preprocessing functions
depend on an AFNI installation. For Windows users, this will also require installation 
of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). AFNI installation instructions can be found 
at: https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/htmldoc/background_install/install_instructs/index.html.


## Installation

niiMLr is not yet published to CRAN, but you can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("willi3by/niiMLr")
```

### Python

niiMLr requires Python in order to run TensorFlow. Before using niiMLr, you may need to [tell reticulate which version of Python to use](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/versions.html).

<summary>Installation on M1 Macs (click to view)</summary>

Getting TensorFlow to work on an M1 Mac currently requires some extra work. (The default Ananconda installation, for example, use the wrong installation of TensorFlow.) Follow the instructions at <https://developer.apple.com/metal/tensorflow-plugin/> to install the correct one using miniforge, a community-driven distribution that supports ARM.

Then, use this code to tell reticulate which Python installation to use:
```r
Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON = paste0(Sys.getenv("HOME"), "/miniforge3/bin/python"))
```

Alternatively, you can use homebrew to install miniforge, use the installation script
from the tensorflow_macos github page, and install dependencies:
```
brew install miniforge
conda create --name tensorflow_macos python=3.8 numpy
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apple/tensorflow_macos/master/scripts/download_and_install.sh)"
```
During the script installation, you will have to specify the path to the newly created conda env, which should be something like: `/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniforge/base/envs/tensorflow_macos`

After installation of tensorflow, activate the environment `conda activate tensorflow_macos` and run the following to install dependencies that must be installed with conda instead of pip:
```
conda install numba
conda install scikit-learn
conda install scipy
```

Finally, in R, set the RETICULATE_PYTHON variable to the python in the conda env:
```r
Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON = "/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniforge/base/envs/tensorflow_macos/bin/python")
```
