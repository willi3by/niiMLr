# niiMLr

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of niiMLr is to wrap functions from other neuroimaging and deep learning
packages to facilitate 3D neural network modeling. Many preprocessing functions
depend on an AFNI installation. For Windows users, this will also require installation 
of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). AFNI installation instructions can be found 
at: https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/htmldoc/background_install/install_instructs/index.html.


## Installation

niiMLr is not yet published to CRAN, but you can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("willi3by/niiMLr")
```

### Python

niiMLr requires Python in order to run TensorFlow. Before using niiMLr, you may need to [tell reticulate which version of Python to use](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/versions.html).

<summary>Installation on M1 Macs (click to view)</summary>

Getting TensorFlow to work on an M1 Mac currently requires some extra work. (The default Ananconda installation, for example, use the wrong installation of TensorFlow.) Follow the instructions at <https://developer.apple.com/metal/tensorflow-plugin/> to install the correct one using miniforge, a community-driven distribution that supports ARM.

Then, use this code to tell reticulate which Python installation to use:
```r
Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON = paste0(Sys.getenv("HOME"), "/miniforge3/bin/python"))
```
